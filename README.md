Advanced Games Implementation is my final year university module, I decided to focus on procedural generation of voxelized meshes that would spawn in chunks generating an infinite world with simpleX noise. You can find all the information on the project [here](https://www.fm96.co.uk/post/worldcraft).

I used Tefel's [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29vUp09JDAg&list=PLgwhqR8QlpRVKQ5JEWcdjV77lex0q-Oth) series as my primary resource. And all credit goes to him for the code in his brilliant tutorials. I built upon the resources by making the code more extensible, easily modifyable and more efficient. I also used [simpleX noise](https://forums.unrealengine.com/development-discussion/engine-source-github/66589-plugin-simplex-noise-1d-2d-3d-4d-fast-perlin-noise-version) to generate the noises. All credit goes to DevDad for this awesome plugin.
